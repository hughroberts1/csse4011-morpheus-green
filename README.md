CSSE4011 Project

# Project B1 - Outdoor Air Quality and Weather Station Network 
* Expand	your	prac 1	and	create	a	network	of atleast	2 air	quality	
monitoring	sensors	using	the	Thingy:52 or	Argon and	the	SEN54.
*  The	stations	should	communicate	with	each	other	and	a	base	node	via	a	
Bluetooth	Mesh	connection. Mesh	network	connection	must	be	shown	to	
work.
* Have	a	web	dashboard	viewer.
