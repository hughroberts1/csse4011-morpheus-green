CSSE4011 Project

# Project B1 - Outdoor Air Quality and Weather Station Network 
* Expand	your	prac 1	and	create	a	network	of atleast	2 air	quality	
monitoring	sensors	using	the	Thingy:52 or	Argon and	the	SEN54.
*  The	stations	should	communicate	with	each	other	and	a	base	node	via	a	
Bluetooth	Mesh	connection. Mesh	network	connection	must	be	shown	to	
work.
* Have	a	web	dashboard	viewer.

# Team Member List and Roles 

* Oliver Roman - Mobile and bluetooth mesh, web dashboard?
* Hugh Roberts - Base and bluetooth mesh, web dashboard?

## Project and Scenario Description 

## Key Performance Indicators
### how is the ’success’ of the project measured?

* KPI1: 
* KPI2: 

## System Overview
### (Hardware Architecture - block diagram of system, Top-level flow chart of software implementation (mote and PC)

## Sensor Integration 
### What sensors are used? What type of data is required? How are the sensors integrated?

## Wireless Network Communication
### What is the network topology used? What network protocols are used and how? What is sort of data rate is required? Should also include a message protocol diagram.

## Algorithms schemes used
### e.g. Machine learning approaches
